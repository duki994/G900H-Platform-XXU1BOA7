<h1>NDK Prebuilt library support:</h1>
<p>Android NDK r5 introduced support for prebuilt libraries (shared and
static), i.e. the ability to include and use, in your applications,
prebuilt version of libraries.</p>
<p>This feature can be useful for two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You want to distribute your own libraries to third-party NDK developers
   without distributing your sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to use a prebuilt version of your own libraries to speed up
   your build.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This document explains how this support works.</p>
<h2>I. Declaring a prebuilt library module:</h2>
<p>Each prebuilt library must be declared as a <em>single</em> independent module to
the build system. Here is a trivial example where we assume that the file
"libfoo.so" is located in the same directory than the Android.mk below:</p>
<pre><code>    LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)

    include $(CLEAR_VARS)
    LOCAL_MODULE := foo-prebuilt
    LOCAL_SRC_FILES := libfoo.so
    include $(PREBUILT_SHARED_LIBRARY)
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that, to declare such a module, you really only need the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Give the module a name (here '<code>foo-prebuilt</code>'). This does not need to
   correspond to the name of the prebuilt library itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assign to <code>LOCAL_SRC_FILES</code> the path to the prebuilt library you are
   providing. As usual, the path is relative to your <code>LOCAL_PATH</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>IMPORTANT: You <em>must</em> ensure that the prebuilt library corresponds
              to the target ABI you are using. More on this later.</p>
<ol>
<li>Include PREBUILT_SHARED_LIBRARY, instead of BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY, if
   you are providing a shared, library. For static ones, use
   PREBUILT_STATIC_LIBRARY.</li>
</ol>
<p>A prebuilt module does not build anything. However, a copy of your prebuilt
shared library will be copied into $PROJECT/obj/local, and another will be
copied and stripped into <code>$PROJECT/libs/&lt;abi&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2>II. Referencing the prebuilt library in other modules:</h2>
<p>Simply list your prebuilt module's name in the <code>LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES</code> or
<code>LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES</code> declaration in the Android.mk of any module that
depends on them.</p>
<p>For example, a naive example of a module using libfoo.so would be:</p>
<pre><code>    include $(CLEAR_VARS)
    LOCAL_MODULE := foo-user
    LOCAL_SRC_FILES := foo-user.c
    LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES := foo-prebuilt
    include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)
</code></pre>
<h2>III. Exporting headers for prebuilt libraries:</h2>
<p>The example above was called 'naive' because, in practice, the code in
foo-user.c is going to depend on specific declarations that are normally
found in a header file distributed with the prebuilt library (e.g. "foo.h").</p>
<p>In other words, foo-user.c is going to have a line like:</p>
<pre><code>  #include &lt;foo.h&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And you need to provide the header and its include path to the compiler
when building the foo-user module.</p>
<p>A simple way to deal with that is to use exports in the prebuilt module
definition. For example, assuming that a file "foo.h" is located under
the 'include' directory relative to the prebuilt module, we can write:</p>
<pre><code>    include $(CLEAR_VARS)
    LOCAL_MODULE := foo-prebuilt
    LOCAL_SRC_FILES := libfoo.so
    LOCAL_EXPORT_C_INCLUDES := $(LOCAL_PATH)/include
    include $(PREBUILT_SHARED_LIBRARY)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>LOCAL_EXPORT_C_INCLUDES</code> definition here ensures that any module that
depends on the prebuilt one will have its <code>LOCAL_C_INCLUDES</code> automatically
prepended with the path to the prebuilt's include directory, and will thus
be able to find headers inside that.</p>
<h2>IV. Debugging prebuilt binaries:</h2>
<p>We recommend you to provide prebuilt shared libraries that contain debug
symbols. The version that is installed into <code>$PROJECT/libs/&lt;abi&gt;/</code> is always
stripped by the NDK build system, but the debug version will be used for
debugging purposes with ndk-gdb.</p>
<h2>V. ABI Selection of prebuilt binaries:</h2>
<p>As said previously, it is crucial to provide a prebuilt shared library
that is compatible with the targeted ABI during the build. To do that,
check for the value of TARGET_ARCH_ABI, its value will be:</p>
<pre><code>  armeabi     =&gt; when targeting ARMv5TE or higher CPUs
  armeabi-v7a =&gt; when targeting ARMv7 or higher CPUs
  x86         =&gt; when targeting x86 CPUs
  mips        =&gt; when targeting MIPS CPUs
</code></pre>
<p>Note that armeabi-v7a systems can run armeabi binaries just fine.</p>
<p>Here's an example where we provide two versions of a prebuilt library
and select which one to copy based on the target ABI:</p>
<pre><code>    include $(CLEAR_VARS)
    LOCAL_MODULE := foo-prebuilt
    LOCAL_SRC_FILES := $(TARGET_ARCH_ABI)/libfoo.so
    LOCAL_EXPORT_C_INCLUDES := $(LOCAL_PATH)/include
    include $(PREBUILT_SHARED_LIBRARY)
</code></pre>
<p>Here. we assume that the prebuilt libraries to copy are under the
following directory hierarchy:</p>
<pre><code>    Android.mk            --&gt; the file above
    armeabi/libfoo.so     --&gt; the armeabi prebuilt shared library
    armeabi-v7a/libfoo.so --&gt; the armeabi-v7a prebuilt shared library
    include/foo.h         --&gt; the exported header file
</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: Remember that you don't need to provide an armeabi-v7a prebuilt
      library, since an armeabi one can easily run on the corresponding
      devices.</p>
