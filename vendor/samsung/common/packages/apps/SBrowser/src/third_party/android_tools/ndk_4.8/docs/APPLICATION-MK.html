<p><code>Application.mk</code> file syntax specification</p>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>This document describes the syntax of <code>Application.mk</code> build files
written to describe the native modules required by your Android
application. To understand what follows, it is assumed that you have
read the <a href="OVERVIEW.html">OVERVIEW</a> file that explains their role and
usage.</p>
<p>Readers of this document should have read <a href="OVERVIEW.html">OVERVIEW</a> and
<a href="ANDROID-MK.html">ANDROID-MK</a>.</p>
<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>The purpose of <code>Application.mk</code> is to describe which native
'modules' (i.e. static/shared libraries) are needed by your
application.</p>
<p>An <code>Application.mk</code> file is usually placed under <code>$PROJECT/jni/Application.mk</code>,
where <code>$PROJECT</code> points to your application's project directory.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to place it under a sub-directory of the top-level
<code>$NDK/apps</code> directory, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>      $NDK/apps/&lt;myapp&gt;/`Application.mk`
</code></pre>
<p>Where <myapp> is a short name used to describe your 'application'
to the NDK build system (this name doesn't go into your generated
shared libraries or your final packages).</p>
<p>The <code>Application.mk</code> is really a tiny GNU Makefile fragment that must
define a few variables:</p>
<hr />
<p><code>APP_PROJECT_PATH</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This variable should give the <em>absolute</em> path to your
   Application's project root directory. This is used to copy/install
   stripped versions of the generated JNI shared libraries to a
   specific location known to the APK-generating tools.</p>
<p>Note that it is optional for <code>$PROJECT/jni/Application.mk</code>, but
   <em>mandatory</em> for <code>$NDK/apps/&lt;myapp&gt;/Application.mk</code></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>APP_MODULES</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this variable is defined, it tells <code>ndk-build</code> to only list the
   corresponding modules and those that they depend on. It must be a
   space-separated list of module names as they appear in the
   <code>LOCAL_MODULE</code> definition of Android.mk files.</p>
<p>It the variable is undefined, <code>ndk-build</code> looks for the list of all
   <em>installable</em> top-level modules, i.e. those listed by your Android.mk
   and any file it includes directly. Imported modules are <em>not</em> top-level
   though.</p>
<p>An installable module is either a shared library or executable, which
   will generate a file in <code>libs/$ABI/</code>.</p>
<p>If the variable is undefined, and there are no installable top-level
   modules in your project, then <code>ndk-build</code> will build all top-level
   static libraries and their dependencies instead. However, these
   libraries will be placed at the usual location under <code>obj/</code> or
   <code>obj-debug/</code>.</p>
<p>NOTE: This variable's behaviour changed in NDK r4. Before that:</p>
<pre><code> - the variable was mandatory in your `Application.mk`
 - all required modules had to be listed explicitly.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>APP_OPTIM</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This optional variable can be defined to either '<code>release</code>' or
   '<code>debug</code>'. This is used to alter the optimization level when
   building your application's modules.</p>
<p>A 'release' mode is the default, and will generate highly
   optimized binaries. The 'debug' mode will generate un-optimized
   binaries which are much easier to debug.</p>
<p>Note that if your application is debuggable (i.e. if your manifest
   sets the <code>android:debuggable</code> attribute to "<code>true</code>" in its <code>&lt;application&gt;</code>
   tag), the default will be 'debug' instead of 'release'. This can
   be overridden by setting <code>APP_OPTIM</code> to '<code>release</code>'.</p>
<p>Note that it is possible to debug both 'release' and 'debug'
   binaries, but the 'release' builds tend to provide less information
   during debugging sessions: some variables are optimized out and
   can't be inspected, code re-ordering can make stepping through
   the code difficult, stack traces may not be reliable, etc...</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>APP_CFLAGS</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A set of C compiler flags passed when compiling any C or C++ source code
   of any of the modules. This can be used to change the build of a given
   module depending on the application that needs it, instead of modifying
   the Android.mk file itself.</p>
<pre><code>    IMPORTANT WARNING: +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    +
    + All paths in these flags should be relative to the top-level NDK
    + directory. For example, if you have the following setup:
    +
    +    sources/foo/Android.mk
    +    sources/bar/Android.mk
    +
    +  To specify in foo/Android.mk that you want to add the path to the
    + 'bar' sources during compilation, you should use:
    +
    +   APP_CFLAGS += -Isources/bar
    +
    + Or alternatively:
    +
    +   APP_CFLAGS += -I$(LOCAL_PATH)/../bar
    +
    + Using '-I../bar' will *NOT* work since it will be equivalent to
    + '-I$NDK_ROOT/../bar' instead.
    +
    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: In android-ndk-1.5_r1, this only applied to C sources, not C++ ones.
         This has been corrected to match the full Android build system.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>APP_CXXFLAGS</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An alias for <code>APP_CPPFLAGS</code>, to be considered obsolete as it may disappear
   in a future release of the NDK.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>APP_CPPFLAGS</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A set of C++ compiler flags passed when building C++ sources <em>only</em>.</p>
<p>NOTE: In android-ndk-1.5_r1, this applied to both C and C++ sources.
         This has been corrected to match the full Android build system.
         You can now use <code>APP_CFLAGS</code> for flags that shall apply to C and
         C++ sources.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>APP_LDFLAGS</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A set of linker flags passed when linking application. This only
   applies when building shared libraries and executables, these
   flags are ignored when building static libraries.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>APP_BUILD_SCRIPT</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, the NDK build system will look for a file named Android.mk
   under <code>$(APP_PROJECT_PATH)/jni</code>, i.e. for the file:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>        $(APP_PROJECT_PATH)/jni/Android.mk
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to override this behaviour, you can define <code>APP_BUILD_SCRIPT</code>
   to point to an alternate build script. A non-absolute path will always
   be interpreted as relative to the NDK's top-level directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>APP_ABI</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, the NDK build system will generate machine code for the
   '<code>armeabi</code>' ABI. This corresponds to an ARMv5TE based CPU with software
   floating point operations. You can use <code>APP_ABI</code> to select a different
   ABI.</p>
<p>For example, to support hardware FPU instructions on ARMv7 based devices,
   use:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          APP_ABI := armeabi-v7a
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Or to support the IA-32 instruction set, use:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          APP_ABI := x86
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Or to support the MIPS instruction set, use:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          APP_ABI := mips
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Or to support all at the same time, use:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          APP_ABI := armeabi armeabi-v7a x86 mips
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Or even better, since NDK r7, you can also use the special value
   '<code>all</code>' which means "all ABIs supported by this NDK release":</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          APP_ABI := all
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>For the list of all supported ABIs and details about their usage and
   limitations, please read <a href="CPU-ARCH-ABIS.html">CPU-ARCH-ABIS</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>APP_PLATFORM</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Name the target Android platform.  For example, '<code>android-3</code>' correspond
   to Android 1.5 system images. For a complete list of platform names and
   corresponding Android system images, read <a href="STABLE-APIS.html">STABLE-APIS</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>APP_STL</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, the NDK build system provides C++ headers for the minimal
   C++ runtime library (<code>/system/lib/libstdc++.so</code>) provided by the Android
   system.</p>
<p>However, the NDK comes with alternative C++ implementations that you can
   use or link to in your own applications. Define <code>APP_STL</code> to select one of
   them. Examples are:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>        APP_STL := stlport_static    --&gt; static STLport library
        APP_STL := stlport_shared    --&gt; shared STLport library
        APP_STL := system            --&gt; default C++ runtime library
</code></pre>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>APP_GNUSTL_FORCE_CPP_FEATURES</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In prior NDK versions, the simple fact of using the GNU libstdc++
   runtime (i.e. by setting <code>APP_STL</code> to either '<code>gnustl_static</code>' or
   '<code>gnustl_shared</code>') enforced the support for exceptions and RTTI in all
   generated machine code. This could be problematic in specific, but rare,
   cases, and also generated un-necessarily bigger code for projects that
   don't require these features.</p>
<p>This bug was fixed in NDK r7b, but this means that if your code requires
   exceptions or RTTI, it should now explicitly say so, either in your
   <code>APP_CPPFLAGS</code>, or your <code>LOCAL_CPPFLAGS</code> / <code>LOCAL_CPP_FEATURES</code> definitions.</p>
<p>To make it easier to port projects to NDK r7b and later, one can
   optionally defined <code>APP_GNUSTL_CPP_FEATURES</code> to contain one or more of the
   following values:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>        exceptions    -&gt; to enforce exceptions support for all modules.
        rtti          -&gt; to enforce rtti support for all modules.
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, to get the exact same behaviour than NDK r7:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>        APP_GNUSTL_FORCE_CPP_FEATURES := exceptions rtti
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>IMPORTANT: This variable is provided here as a convenience to make it
              easier to transition to a newer version of the NDK. It will
              be removed in a future revision. We thus encourage all
              developers to modify the module definitions properly instead
              of relying on it here.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>APP_SHORT_COMMANDS</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The equivalent of <code>LOCAL_SHORT_COMMANDS</code> for your whole project. See the
   documentation for this variable in <a href="ANDROID-MK.html">ANDROID-MK</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>NDK_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Define this variable to either 4.6, 4.7 or 4.8 to select version of
   the GCC compiler. 4.6 is the default</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>APP_PIE</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting from Jelly Bean (4.1), Android's dynamic linker supports
   position-independent executables (PIE), which are built with <code>-fPIE</code>.
   This flag makes it harder to exploit memory corruption bugs by
   randomization the location of the code.
   By default, <code>ndk-build</code> will automatically set this value to '<code>true</code>' if
   your project targets <code>android-16</code> or higher. You may set it manually
   to either '<code>true</code>' or '<code>false</code>'.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: PIE executables <em>cannot</em> run on Android releases prior to 4.1.</p>
<p>Note that this only applies to executables. It has no effect when
   building shared or static libraries.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>APP_THIN_ARCHIVE</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets the default value of <code>LOCAL_THIN_ARCHIVE</code> for all static library
   modules in this project. For more information, see the documentation
   for <code>LOCAL_THIN_ARCHIVE</code> in <a href="ANDROID-MK.html">ANDROID-MK</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>A trivial <code>Application.mk</code> file would be:</p>
<pre><code>      -------------- cut here -------------------------
      APP_PROJECT_PATH := &lt;path to project&gt;
      -------------- cut here -------------------------
