<p><code>Android.mk</code> file syntax specification</p>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>This document describes the syntax of <code>Android.mk</code> build file
written to describe your C and C++ source files to the Android
NDK. To understand what follows, it is assumed that you have
read the <a href="OVERVIEW.html">OVERVIEW</a> file that explains their role and
usage.</p>
<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>An <code>Android.mk</code> file is written to describe your sources to the
build system. More specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The file is really a tiny GNU Makefile fragment that will be
  parsed one or more times by the build system. As such, you
  should try to minimize the variables you declare there and
  do not assume that anything is not defined during parsing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The file syntax is designed to allow you to group your
  sources into 'modules'. A module is one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A static library.</li>
<li>A shared library.</li>
<li>A standalone executable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Only shared libraries will be installed/copied to your
  application package. Static libraries can be used to generate
  shared libraries though.</p>
<p>You can define one or more modules in each <code>Android.mk</code> file,
  and you can use the same source file in several modules.</p>
<ul>
<li>The build system handles many details for you. For example, you
  don't need to list header files or explicit dependencies between
  generated files in your <code>Android.mk</code>. The NDK build system will
  compute these automatically for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>This also means that, when updating to newer releases of the NDK,
  you should be able to benefit from new toolchain/platform support
  without having to touch your <code>Android.mk</code> files.</p>
<p>Note that the syntax is <em>very</em> close to the one used in <code>Android.mk</code> files
distributed with the full open-source Android platform sources. While
the build system implementation that uses them is different, this is
an intentional design decision made to allow reuse of 'external' libraries'
source code easier for application developers.</p>
<h2>Simple example:</h2>
<p>Before describing the syntax in details, let's consider the simple
"hello JNI" example, i.e. the files under:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>samples/hello-jni</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, we can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>src</code> directory containing the Java sources for the
    sample Android project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>jni</code> directory containing the native source for
    the sample, i.e. <code>jni/hello-jni.c</code></p>
<p>This source file implements a simple shared library that
implements a native method that returns a string to the
VM application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>jni/Android.mk</code> file that describes the shared library
    to the NDK build system. Its content is:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1></h1>
<pre><code>    ---------- cut here ------------------
    LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)

    include $(CLEAR_VARS)

    LOCAL_MODULE    := hello-jni
    LOCAL_SRC_FILES := hello-jni.c

    include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)
    ---------- cut here ------------------
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's explain these lines:</p>
<pre><code>    LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)
</code></pre>
<p>An <code>Android.mk</code> file must begin with the definition of the <code>LOCAL_PATH</code> variable.
It is used to locate source files in the development tree. In this example,
the macro function 'my-dir', provided by the build system, is used to return
the path of the current directory (i.e. the directory containing the
<code>Android.mk</code> file itself).</p>
<pre><code>    include $(CLEAR_VARS)
</code></pre>
<p>The CLEAR_VARS variable is provided by the build system and points to a
special GNU Makefile that will clear many <code>LOCAL_XXX</code> variables for you
(e.g. <code>LOCAL_MODULE</code>, <code>LOCAL_SRC_FILES</code>, <code>LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES</code>, etc...),
with the exception of <code>LOCAL_PATH</code>. This is needed because all build
control files are parsed in a single GNU Make execution context where
all variables are global.</p>
<pre><code>    LOCAL_MODULE := hello-jni
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>LOCAL_MODULE</code> variable must be defined to identify each module you
describe in your <code>Android.mk</code>. The name must be <em>unique</em> and not contain
any spaces. Note that the build system will automatically add proper
prefix and suffix to the corresponding generated file. In other words,
a shared library module named 'foo' will generate 'libfoo.so'.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE:
If you name your module 'libfoo', the build system will not
add another 'lib' prefix and will generate libfoo.so as well.
This is to support <code>Android.mk</code> files that originate from the
Android platform sources, would you need to use these.</p>
<pre><code>    LOCAL_SRC_FILES := hello-jni.c
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>LOCAL_SRC_FILES</code> variables must contain a list of C and/or C++ source
files that will be built and assembled into a module. Note that you should
not list header and included files here, because the build system will
compute dependencies automatically for you; just list the source files
that will be passed directly to a compiler, and you should be good.</p>
<p>Note that the default extension for C++ source files is '.cpp'. It is
however possible to specify a different one by defining the variable
<code>LOCAL_CPP_EXTENSION</code>. Don't forget the initial dot (i.e. '.cxx' will
work, but not 'cxx').</p>
<pre><code>    include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)
</code></pre>
<p>The BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY is a variable provided by the build system that
points to a GNU Makefile script that is in charge of collecting all the
information you defined in <code>LOCAL_XXX</code> variables since the latest
'include $(CLEAR_VARS)' and determine what to build, and how to do it
exactly. There is also BUILD_STATIC_LIBRARY to generate a static library.</p>
<p>There are more complex examples in the samples directories, with commented
<code>Android.mk</code> files that you can look at.</p>
<h2>Reference:</h2>
<p>This is the list of variables you should either rely on or define in
an <code>Android.mk</code>. You can define other variables for your own usage, but
the NDK build system reserves the following variable names:</p>
<ul>
<li>Names that begin with <code>LOCAL_</code>  (e.g. <code>LOCAL_MODULE</code>)</li>
<li>Names that begin with PRIVATE_, <code>NDK_</code> or <code>APP_</code>  (used internally)</li>
<li>Lower-case names (used internally, e.g. <code>my-dir</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to define your own convenience variables in an <code>Android.mk</code>
file, we recommend using the MY_ prefix, for a trivial example:</p>
<pre><code>    ---------- cut here ------------------
    MY_SOURCES := foo.c
    ifneq ($(MY_CONFIG_BAR),)
      MY_SOURCES += bar.c
    endif

    LOCAL_SRC_FILES += $(MY_SOURCES)
    ---------- cut here ------------------
</code></pre>
<p>So, here we go:</p>
<h2>NDK-provided variables:</h2>
<p>These GNU Make variables are defined by the build system before
your <code>Android.mk</code> file is parsed. Note that under certain circumstances
the NDK might parse your <code>Android.mk</code> several times, each with different
definition for some of these variables.</p>
<hr />
<p>CLEAR_VARS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Points to a build script that undefines nearly all <code>LOCAL_XXX</code> variables
listed in the "Module-description" section below. You must include
the script before starting a new module, e.g.:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>        include $(CLEAR_VARS)
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Points to a build script that collects all the information about the
module you provided in <code>LOCAL_XXX</code> variables and determines how to build
a target shared library from the sources you listed. Note that you
must have <code>LOCAL_MODULE</code> and <code>LOCAL_SRC_FILES</code> defined, at a minimum before
including this file. Example usage:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>        include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>note that this will generate a file named <code>lib$(LOCAL_MODULE).so</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>BUILD_STATIC_LIBRARY</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A variant of BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY that is used to build a target static
   library instead. Static libraries are not copied into your
   project/packages but can be used to build shared libraries (see
   <code>LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES</code> and <code>LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES</code> described below).
   Example usage:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>        include $(BUILD_STATIC_LIBRARY)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that this will generate a file named <code>lib$(LOCAL_MODULE).a</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>PREBUILT_SHARED_LIBRARY</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Points to a build script used to specify a prebuilt shared library.
   Unlike BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY and BUILD_STATIC_LIBRARY, the value
   of <code>LOCAL_SRC_FILES</code> must be a single path to a prebuilt shared
   library (e.g. <code>foo/libfoo.so</code>), instead of a source file.</p>
<p>You can reference the prebuilt library in another module using
   the <code>LOCAL_PREBUILTS</code> variable (see <a href="PREBUILTS.html">PREBUILTS</a> for more
   information).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>PREBUILT_STATIC_LIBRARY</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the same as PREBUILT_SHARED_LIBRARY, but for a static library
   file instead. See <a href="PREBUILTS.html">PREBUILTS</a> for more.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>TARGET_ARCH</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Name of the target CPU architecture as it is specified by the
   full Android open-source build. This is 'arm' for any ARM-compatible
   build, independent of the CPU architecture revision.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>TARGET_PLATFORM</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Name of the target Android platform when this <code>Android.mk</code> is parsed.
   For example, 'android-3' correspond to Android 1.5 system images. For
   a complete list of platform names and corresponding Android system
   images, read <a href="STABLE-APIS.html">STABLE APIS</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>TARGET_ARCH_ABI</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Name of the target CPU+ABI when this <code>Android.mk</code> is parsed.
   Four values are supported at the moment:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>   armeabi
        For ARMv5TE

   armeabi-v7a
        For ARMv7

   x86
        For i686

   mips
        For mips32 (r1)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Up to Android NDK 1.6_r1, this variable was simply defined
         as '<code>arm</code>'. However, the value has been redefined to better
         match what is used internally by the Android platform.</p>
<p>For more details about architecture ABIs and corresponding
   compatibility issues, please read <a href="CPU-ARCH-ABIS.html">CPU ARCH ABIS</a></p>
<p>Other target ABIs will be introduced in future releases of the NDK
   and will have a different name. Note that all ARM-based ABIs will
   have 'TARGET_ARCH' defined to '<code>arm</code>', but may have different
   'TARGET_ARCH_ABI'</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>TARGET_ABI</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The concatenation of target platform and ABI, it really is defined
   as <code>$(TARGET_PLATFORM)-$(TARGET_ARCH_ABI)</code> and is useful when you want
   to test against a specific target system image for a real device.</p>
<p>By default, this will be '<code>android-3-armeabi</code>'</p>
<p>(Up to Android NDK 1.6_r1, this used to be '<code>android-3-arm</code>' by default)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>NDK-provided function macros:</h2>
<p>The following are GNU Make 'function' macros, and must be evaluated
by using '$(call <function>)'. They return textual information.</p>
<hr />
<p>my-dir</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns the path of the last included Makefile, which typically is
   the current <code>Android.mk</code>'s directory. This is useful to define
   <code>LOCAL_PATH</code> at the start of your <code>Android.mk</code> as with:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the way GNU Make works, this really returns
   the path of the <em>last</em> <em>included</em> <em>Makefile</em> during the parsing of
   build scripts. Do not call <code>my-dir</code> after including another file.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following example:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)

          ... declare one module

          include $(LOCAL_PATH)/foo/`Android.mk`

          LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)

          ... declare another module
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem here is that the second call to <code>my-dir</code> will define
   <code>LOCAL_PATH</code> to <code>$PATH/foo</code> instead of <code>$PATH</code>, due to the include that
   was performed before that.</p>
<p>For this reason, it's better to put additional includes after
   everything else in an <code>Android.mk</code>, as in:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)

          ... declare one module

          LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)

          ... declare another module

          # extra includes at the end of the `Android.mk`
          include $(LOCAL_PATH)/foo/`Android.mk`
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>If this is not convenient, save the value of the first <code>my-dir</code> call
   into another variable, for example:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          MY_LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)

          LOCAL_PATH := $(MY_LOCAL_PATH)

          ... declare one module

          include $(LOCAL_PATH)/foo/`Android.mk`

          LOCAL_PATH := $(MY_LOCAL_PATH)

          ... declare another module
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>all-subdir-makefiles</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns a list of <code>Android.mk</code> located in all sub-directories of
   the current 'my-dir' path. For example, consider the following
   hierarchy:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          sources/foo/Android.mk
          sources/foo/lib1/Android.mk
          sources/foo/lib2/Android.mk
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>If sources/foo/<code>Android.mk</code> contains the single line:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          include $(call all-subdir-makefiles)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Then it will include automatically sources/foo/lib1/<code>Android.mk</code> and
   sources/foo/lib2/<code>Android.mk</code></p>
<p>This function can be used to provide deep-nested source directory
   hierarchies to the build system. Note that by default, the NDK
   will only look for files in sources/*/<code>Android.mk</code></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>this-makefile</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns the path of the current Makefile (i.e. where the function
   is called).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>parent-makefile</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns the path of the parent Makefile in the inclusion tree,
   i.e. the path of the Makefile that included the current one.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>grand-parent-makefile</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Guess what...</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>import-module</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A function that allows you to find and include the <code>Android.mk</code>
   of another module by name. A typical example is:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>        $(call import-module,&lt;name&gt;)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>And this will look for the module tagged <name> in the list of
   directories referenced by your <code>NDK_MODULE_PATH</code> environment
   variable, and include its <code>Android.mk</code> automatically for you.</p>
<p>Read <a href="IMPORT-MODULE.html">IMPORT-MODULE</a> for more details.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Module-description variables:</h2>
<p>The following variables are used to describe your module to the build
system. You should define some of them between an '<code>include $(CLEAR_VARS)</code>'
and an '<code>include $(BUILD_XXXXX)</code>'. As written previously, $(CLEAR_VARS) is
a script that will undefine/clear all of these variables, unless explicitly
noted in their description.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_PATH</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This variable is used to give the path of the current file.
   You MUST define it at the start of your <code>Android.mk</code>, which can
   be done with:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>        LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>This variable is <em>not</em> cleared by $(CLEAR_VARS) so only one
   definition per <code>Android.mk</code> is needed (in case you define several
   modules in a single file).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_MODULE</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the name of your module. It must be unique among all
   module names, and shall not contain any space. You MUST define
   it before including any $(BUILD_XXXX) script.</p>
<p>By default, the module name determines the name of generated files,
   e.g. lib<foo>.so for a shared library module named <foo>. However
   you should only refer to other modules with their 'normal'
   name (e.g. <foo>) in your NDK build files (either <code>Android.mk</code>
   or Application.mk)</p>
<p>You can override this default with <code>LOCAL_MODULE_FILENAME</code> (see below)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_MODULE_FILENAME</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This variable is optional, and allows you to redefine the name of
   generated files. By default, module <foo> will always generate a
   static library named lib<foo>.a or a shared library named lib<foo>.so,
   which are standard Unix conventions.</p>
<p>You can override this by defining <code>LOCAL_MODULE_FILENAME</code>, For example:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          LOCAL_MODULE := foo-version-1
          LOCAL_MODULE_FILENAME := libfoo
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>*NOTE(: You should not put a path or file extension in your
   <code>LOCAL_MODULE_FILENAME</code>, these will be handled automatically by the
   build system.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_SRC_FILES</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a list of source files that will be built for your module.
   Only list the files that will be passed to a compiler, since the
   build system automatically computes dependencies for you.</p>
<p>Note that source files names are relative to <code>LOCAL_PATH</code> and
   you can use path components, e.g.:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>        LOCAL_SRC_FILES := foo.c \
                           toto/bar.c
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Absolute file paths are also supported:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>        LOCAL_SRC_FILES := /home/user/mysources/foo.c
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>or on Windows:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>        LOCAL_SRC_FILES := c:/Users/user/sources/foo.c
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Avoiding absolute file paths is recommended, this makes your
   <code>Android.mk</code> easy to reuse on a different machine / system.</p>
<p>NOTE: Always use Unix-style forward slashes (/) in build files.
         Windows-style back-slashes will not be handled properly.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_CPP_EXTENSION</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an optional variable that can be defined to indicate
   the file extension(s) of C++ source files. They must begin with a dot.
   The default is '.cpp' but you can change it. For example:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          LOCAL_CPP_EXTENSION := .cxx
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Since NDK r7, you can list several extensions in this variable, as in:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          LOCAL_CPP_EXTENSION := .cxx .cpp .cc
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_CPP_FEATURES</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an optional variable that can be defined to indicate
   that your code relies on specific C++ features. To indicate that
   your code uses RTTI (RunTime Type Information), use the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          LOCAL_CPP_FEATURES := rtti
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>To indicate that your code uses C++ exceptions, use:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          LOCAL_CPP_FEATURES := exceptions
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also use both of them with (order is not important):</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          LOCAL_CPP_FEATURES := rtti features
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The effect of this variable is to enable the right compiler/linker
   flags when building your modules from sources. For prebuilt binaries,
   this also helps declare which features the binary relies on to ensure
   the final link works correctly.</p>
<p>It is recommended to use this variable instead of enabling <code>-frtti</code> and
   <code>-fexceptions</code> directly in your <code>LOCAL_CPPFLAGS</code> definition.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_C_INCLUDES</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An optional list of paths, relative to the NDK <em>root</em> directory,
   which will be appended to the include search path when compiling
   all sources (C, C++ and Assembly). For example:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          LOCAL_C_INCLUDES := sources/foo
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Or even:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          LOCAL_C_INCLUDES := $(LOCAL_PATH)/../foo
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>These are placed before any corresponding inclusion flag in
   <code>LOCAL_CFLAGS</code> / <code>LOCAL_CPPFLAGS</code></p>
<p>The <code>LOCAL_C_INCLUDES</code> path are also used automatically when
   launching native debugging with ndk-gdb.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_CFLAGS</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An optional set of compiler flags that will be passed when building
   C <em>and</em> C++ source files.</p>
<p>This can be useful to specify additional macro definitions or
   compile options.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Try not to change the optimization/debugging level in
              your <code>Android.mk</code>, this can be handled automatically for
              you by specifying the appropriate information in
              your Application.mk, and will let the NDK generate
              useful data files used during debugging.</p>
<p>NOTE: In android-ndk-1.5_r1, the corresponding flags only applied
         to C source files, not C++ ones. This has been corrected to
         match the full Android build system behaviour. (You can use
         <code>LOCAL_CPPFLAGS</code> to specify flags for C++ sources only now).</p>
<p>It is possible to specify additional include paths with
   <code>LOCAL_CFLAGS</code> += <code>-I&lt;path&gt;,</code> however, it is better to use <code>LOCAL_C_INCLUDES</code>
   for this, since the paths will then also be used during native
   debugging with ndk-gdb.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_CXXFLAGS</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An alias for <code>LOCAL_CPPFLAGS</code>. Note that use of this flag is obsolete
   as it may disappear in future releases of the NDK.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_CPPFLAGS</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An optional set of compiler flags that will be passed when building
   C++ source files <em>only</em>. They will appear after the <code>LOCAL_CFLAGS</code>
   on the compiler's command-line.</p>
<p>NOTE: In android-ndk-1.5_r1, the corresponding flags applied to
         both C and C++ sources. This has been corrected to match the
         full Android build system. (You can use <code>LOCAL_CFLAGS</code> to specify
         flags for both C and C++ sources now).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The list of static libraries modules that the current module depends
   on.</p>
<p>If the current module is a shared library or an executable, this will
   force these libraries to be linked into the resulting binary.</p>
<p>If the current module is a static library, this simply tells that
   another other module that depends on the current one will also
   depend on the listed libraries.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The list of shared libraries <em>modules</em> this module depends on at runtime.
   This is necessary at link time and to embed the corresponding information
   in the generated file.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A variant of <code>LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES</code> used to express that the corresponding
   library module should be used as "whole archives" to the linker. See the
   GNU linker's documentation for the <code>--whole-archive</code> flag.</p>
<p>This is generally useful when there are circular dependencies between
   several static libraries. Note that when used to build a shared library,
   this will force all object files from your whole static libraries to be
   added to the final binary. This is not true when generating executables
   though.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_LDLIBS</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The list of additional linker flags to be used when building your
   shared library or executable. This is useful to pass the name of
   specific system libraries with the '<code>-l</code>' prefix. For example, the
   following will tell the linker to generate a module that links to
   <code>/system/lib/libz.so</code> at load time:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>        LOCAL_LDLIBS := -lz
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>See <a href="STABLE-APIS.html">STABLE-APIS</a> for the list of exposed system libraries you
   can linked against with this NDK release.</p>
<p>NOTE: This is ignored for static libraries, and ndk-build will print
         a warning if you define it in such a module.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_LDFLAGS</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The list of other linker flags to be used when building your shared
   library or executable. For example, the following will use the <code>ld.bfd</code>
   linker on ARM/X86 GCC 4.6+ where <code>ld.gold</code> is the default</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>        LOCAL_LDFLAGS += -fuse-ld=bfd
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: This is ignored for static libraries, and ndk-build will print
         a warning if you define it in such a module.</p>

<p><code>LOCAL_ALLOW_UNDEFINED_SYMBOLS</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, any undefined reference encountered when trying to build
   a shared library will result in an "undefined symbol" error. This is a
   great help to catch bugs in your source code.</p>
<p>However, if for some reason you need to disable this check, set this
   variable to '<code>true</code>'. Note that the corresponding shared library may fail
   to load at runtime.</p>
<p><em>NOTE</em>: This is ignored for static libraries, and ndk-build will print
         a warning if you define it in such a module.</p>

<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_ARM_MODE</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, ARM target binaries will be generated in 'thumb' mode, where
   each instruction are 16-bit wide. You can define this variable to '<code>arm</code>'
   if you want to force the generation of the module's object files in
   'arm' (32-bit instructions) mode. E.g.:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>        LOCAL_ARM_MODE := arm
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that you can also instruct the build system to only build specific
   sources in ARM mode by appending an '<code>.arm</code>' suffix to its source file
   name. For example, with:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>        LOCAL_SRC_FILES := foo.c bar.c.arm
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Tells the build system to always compile '<code>bar.c</code>' in ARM mode, and to
   build <code>foo.c</code> according to the value of <code>LOCAL_ARM_MODE</code>.</p>
<p>NOTE: Setting <code>APP_OPTIM</code> to '<code>debug</code>' in your <code>Application.mk</code> will also force
         the generation of ARM binaries as well. This is due to bugs in the
         toolchain debugger that don't deal too well with thumb code.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_ARM_NEON</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defining this variable to '<code>true</code>' allows the use of ARM Advanced SIMD
   (a.k.a. NEON) GCC intrinsics in your C and C++ sources, as well as
   NEON instructions in Assembly files.</p>
<p>You should only define it when targeting the '<code>armeabi-v7a</code>' ABI that
   corresponds to the ARMv7 instruction set. Note that not all ARMv7
   based CPUs support the NEON instruction set extensions and that you
   should perform runtime detection to be able to use this code at runtime
   safely. To learn more about this, please read the documentation at
   <a href="CPU-ARM-NEON.html">CPU-ARM-NEON</a> and <a href="CPU-FEATURES.html">CPU-FEATURES</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also specify that only specific source files
   may be compiled with NEON support by using the '<code>.neon</code>' suffix, as
   in:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>        LOCAL_SRC_FILES = foo.c.neon bar.c zoo.c.arm.neon
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>In this example, '<code>foo.c</code>' will be compiled in thumb+neon mode,
   '<code>bar.c</code>' will be compiled in 'thumb' mode, and '<code>zoo.c</code>' will be
   compiled in 'arm+neon' mode.</p>
<p>Note that the '<code>.neon</code>' suffix must appear after the '<code>.arm</code>' suffix
   if you use both (i.e. <code>foo.c.arm.neon</code> works, but not <code>foo.c.neon.arm</code> !)</p>

<p><code>LOCAL_DISABLE_NO_EXECUTE</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Android NDK r4 added support for the "NX bit" security feature.
   It is enabled by default, but you can disable it if you <em>really</em>
   need to by setting this variable to 'true'.</p>
<p>NOTE: This feature does not modify the ABI and is only enabled on
         kernels targeting ARMv6+ CPU devices. Machine code generated
         with this feature enabled will run unmodified on devices
         running earlier CPU architectures.</p>

<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_DISABLE_RELRO</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, NDK compiled code is built with read-only relocations
   and GOT protection.  This instructs the runtime linker to mark
   certain regions of memory as being read-only after relocation,
   making certain security exploits (such as GOT overwrites) harder
   to perform.</p>
<p>It is enabled by default, but you can disable it if you <em>really</em>
   need to by setting this variable to '<code>true</code>'.</p>
<p>NOTE: These protections are only effective on newer Android devices
         ("Jelly Bean" and beyond). The code will still run on older
         versions (albeit without memory protections).</p>

<p><code>LOCAL_DISABLE_FORMAT_STRING_CHECKS</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, NDK compiled code is compiled with format string
   protection. This forces a compiler error if a non-constant format
   string is used in a printf style function.</p>
<p>It is enabled by default, but you can disable it if you <em>really</em>
   need to by setting this variable to '<code>true</code>'.</p>

<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_EXPORT_CFLAGS</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Define this variable to record a set of C/C++ compiler flags that will
   be added to the <code>LOCAL_CFLAGS</code> definition of any other module that uses
   this one with <code>LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES</code> or <code>LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES</code>.</p>
<p>For example, consider the module '<code>foo</code>' with the following definition:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          include $(CLEAR_VARS)
          LOCAL_MODULE := foo
          LOCAL_SRC_FILES := foo/foo.c
          LOCAL_EXPORT_CFLAGS := -DFOO=1
          include $(BUILD_STATIC_LIBRARY)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>And another module, named '<code>bar</code>' that depends on it as:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          include $(CLEAR_VARS)
          LOCAL_MODULE := bar
          LOCAL_SRC_FILES := bar.c
          LOCAL_CFLAGS := -DBAR=2
          LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES := foo
          include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Then, the flags '<code>-DFOO=1</code> <code>-DBAR=2</code>' will be passed to the compiler when
   building <code>bar.c</code>.</p>
<p>Exported flags are prepended to your module's <code>LOCAL_CFLAGS</code> so you can
   easily override them. They are also transitive: if '<code>zoo</code>' depends on
   '<code>bar</code>' which depends on '<code>foo</code>', then '<code>zoo</code>' will also inherit all flags
   exported by '<code>foo</code>'.</p>
<p>Finally, exported flags are <em>not</em> used when building the module that
   exports them. In the above example, <code>-DFOO=1</code> would not be passed to the
   compiler when building <code>foo/foo.c</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_EXPORT_CPPFLAGS</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Same as <code>LOCAL_EXPORT_CFLAGS</code>, but for C++ flags only.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_EXPORT_C_INCLUDES</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Same as <code>LOCAL_EXPORT_CFLAGS</code>, but for C include paths.
   This can be useful if 'bar.c' wants to include headers
   that are provided by module 'foo'.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_EXPORT_LDLIBS</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Same as <code>LOCAL_EXPORT_CFLAGS</code>, but for linker flags. Note that the
   imported linker flags will be appended to your module's <code>LOCAL_LDLIBS</code>
   though, due to the way Unix linkers work.</p>
<p>This is typically useful when module '<code>foo</code>' is a static library and has
   code that depends on a system library. <code>LOCAL_EXPORT_LDLIBS</code> can then be
   used to export the dependency. For example:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          include $(CLEAR_VARS)
          LOCAL_MODULE := foo
          LOCAL_SRC_FILES := foo/foo.c
          LOCAL_EXPORT_LDLIBS := -llog
          include $(BUILD_STATIC_LIBRARY)

          include $(CLEAR_VARS)
          LOCAL_MODULE := bar
          LOCAL_SRC_FILES := bar.c
          LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES := foo
          include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>There, <code>libbar.so</code> will be built with a <code>-llog</code> at the end of the linker
   command to indicate that it depends on the system logging library,
   because it depends on '<code>foo</code>'.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_SHORT_COMMANDS</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set this variable to '<code>true</code>' when your module has a very high number of
   sources and/or dependent static or shared libraries. This forces the
   build system to use an intermediate list file, and use it with the
   library archiver or static linker with the <code>@$(listfile)</code> syntax.</p>
<p>This can be useful on Windows, where the command-line only accepts
   a maximum of 8191 characters, which can be too small for complex
   projects.</p>
<p>This also impacts the compilation of individual source files, placing
   nearly all compiler flags inside list files too.</p>
<p>Note that any other value than '<code>true</code>' will revert to the default
   behaviour. You can also define <code>APP_SHORT_COMMANDS</code> in your
   Application.mk to force this behaviour for all modules in your
   project.</p>
<p><em>NOTE</em>: We do not recommend enabling this feature by default, since it
         makes the build slower.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_THIN_ARCHIVE</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set this variable to '<code>true</code>' when building static libraries. This will
   generate a 'thin archive', i.e. a library file (e.g. <code>libfoo.a</code>) which
   doesn't contain object files, but simply file paths to the actual
   objects that it should normally contain.</p>
<p>This is useful to reduce the size of your build output. The drawback
   is that such libraries <em>cannot</em> be moved to a different location
   (all paths inside them are relative).</p>
<p>Valid values are '<code>true</code>', '<code>false</code>' or empty. A default value can be
   set in your Application.mk through <code>APP_THIN_ARCHIVE</code>.</p>
<p><em>NOTE</em>: This is ignored for non-static library modules, or prebuilt
   static library ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><code>LOCAL_FILTER_ASM</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Define this variable to a shell command that will be used to filter
   the assembly files from, or generated from, your <code>LOCAL_SRC_FILES</code>.</p>
<p>When it is defined, the following happens:</p>
<pre><code> - Any C or C++ source file is generated into a temporary assembly
   file (instead of being compiled into an object file).

 - Any temporary assembly file, and any assembly file listed in
   `LOCAL_SRC_FILES` is sent through the `LOCAL_FILTER_ASM` command
   to generate _another_ temporary assembly file.

 - These filtered assembly files are compiled into object file.
</code></pre>
<p>In other words, If you have:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          LOCAL_SRC_FILES  := foo.c bar.S
          LOCAL_FILTER_ASM := myasmfilter

        foo.c --1--&gt; $OBJS_DIR/foo.S.original --2--&gt; $OBJS_DIR/foo.S --3--&gt; $OBJS_DIR/foo.o
        bar.S                                 --2--&gt; $OBJS_DIR/bar.S --3--&gt; $OBJS_DIR/bar.o
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Were "1" corresponds to the compiler, "2" to the filter, and "3" to the
   assembler. The filter must be a standalone shell command that takes the
   name of the input file as its first argument, and the name of the output
   file as the second one, as in:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>          myasmfilter $OBJS_DIR/foo.S.original $OBJS_DIR/foo.S
          myasmfilter bar.S $OBJS_DIR/bar.S
