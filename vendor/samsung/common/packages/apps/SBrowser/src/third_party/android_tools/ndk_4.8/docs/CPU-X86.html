<h1>Android NDK x86 (a.k.a. IA-32) instruction set support</h1>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>Android NDK r6 added support for the '<code>x86</code>' ABI, that allows native code to
run on Android-based devices running on CPUs supporting the IA-32 instruction
set.</p>
<p>The Android x86 ABI itself is fully specified in <a href="CPU-ARCH-ABIS.html">CPU-ARCH-ABIS</a>.</p>
<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>Generating x86 machine code is simple: just add 'x86' to your <code>APP_ABI</code>
definition in your Application.mk file, for example:</p>
<pre><code>    APP_ABI := armeabi armeabi-v7a x86
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, since NDK r7, you can use:</p>
<pre><code>    APP_ABI := all
</code></pre>
<p>will generate machine code for all supported ABIs with this NDK. Doing so
will ensure that your application package contains libraries for all target
ABIs. Note that this has an impact on package size, since each ABI will
correspond to its own set of native libraries built from the same sources.</p>
<p>The default ABI is still '<code>armeabi</code>', if unspecified in your project.</p>
<p>As you would expect, generated libraries will go into <code>$PROJECT/libs/x86/</code>, and
will be embedded into your .apk under <code>/lib/x86/</code>.</p>
<p>And just like other ABIs, the Android package manager will extract these
libraries on a <em>compatible</em> x86-based device automatically at install time,
to put them under <dataPath>/lib, where <dataPath> is the
application's private data directory.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Google Play server is capable of filtering applications
based on the native libraries they embed and your device's target CPU.</p>
<p>Debugging with ndk-gdb should work exactly as described under <a href="NDK-GDB.html">NDK-GDB</a>.</p>
<h2>Standalone-toolchain:</h2>
<p>It is possible to use the x86 toolchain with NDK r6 in stand-alone mode.
See <a href="STANDALONE-TOOLCHAIN.html">STANDALONE-TOOLCHAIN</a> for more details. Briefly speaking,
it is now possible to run:</p>
<pre><code>  `$NDK/build/tools/make-standalone-toolchain.sh` --arch=x86 --install-dir=&lt;path&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The toolchain binaries have the <code>i686-linux-android- prefix</code>.</p>
<h2>Compatibility:</h2>
<p>The minimal native API level provided by official Android x86 platform builds
is 9, which corresponds to all the native APIs provided by Android 2.3, i.e.
Gingerbread (note also that no new native APIs were introduced by Honeycomb).</p>
<p>You won't have to change anything to your project files if you target an older
API level: the NDK build script will automatically select the right set of
native platform headers/libraries for you.</p>
