Description:
The Android SDK/NDK provide API libraries and developer tools necessary to
build, test and debug for Android.

Local Modifications:
- Removed .gitignore files in ndk folder so all files would be checked in.
- Overwrite linker with 64-bit linker in the NDK:
  We use the 64-bit linker from $ROOT/src/third_party/aosp/.  The linkers in the
  following two directories have been overwritten with the 64-bit linker and the
  old linker has been copied as <old_linker_name>.orig:
  1) ndk/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.4.3/prebuilt/linux-x86/
         arm-linux-androideabi/bin/ld.orig
  2) ndk/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.4.3/prebuilt/linux-x86/bin/
         arm-linux-androideabi-ld.orig
- sdk/extras added gcm library (revision 3)
- Updated trace-viewer script to r220 under sdk/tools/systrace.
  Steps to update to the latest version of trace-viewer:
    git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/chromium-trace
    cd chromium-trace
    ./update.py
    cp script.js style.css $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/tools/systrace
