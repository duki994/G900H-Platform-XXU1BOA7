/**
 * A simple data structure for international postal addresses.
 *
 * Addresses may seem simple, but even within the US there are many quirks (hyphenated street
 * addresses, etc.), and internationally addresses vary a great deal. The most sane and complete in
 * many ways is the OASIS "extensible Address Language", xAL, which is a published and documented
 * XML schema:
 *
 * http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ciq/download.shtml
 *
 * We have not represented all the fields, but the intent is that if you need to add something, you
 * should follow the OASIS standard.
 *
 * An example address:
 * <p>postalCountry: US</p>
 * <p>addressLine1: 1098 Alta Ave</p>
 * <p>addressLine2:</p>
 * <p>adminstrativeArea: CA</p>
 * <p>locality: Mountain View</p>
 * <p>dependentLocality:</p>
 * <p>postalCode: 94043</p>
 * <p>sortingCode:</p>
 * <p>organization: Google</p>
 * <p>recipient: Chen-Kang Yang</p>
 * <p>language code: en</p>
 *
 * Note that sub-administrative area is NOT used in Address Widget. Sub-administrative Area is
 * second-level administrative subdivision of this country. For examples: US county, IT province, UK
 * county. This level of geo information is not required to fill out address form, therefore is
 * neglected.
 *
 * All values stored in this class are trimmed. Also, if you try to set a field with an empty string
 * or a string consists of only spaces, it will not be set.
