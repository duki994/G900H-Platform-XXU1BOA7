This file is checked in so that the add-ons directory does not need to be
recreated during ant builds.  This was causing flaky failures (i.e. build
breaks) on the bots when the android_tools directory was being deleted and then
re-checked out.  Here is an example:

http://build.chromium.org/p/chromium/builders/Android%20Builder/builds/12735/steps/compile/logs/stdio

One possible reason is that multiple parallel processes are trying to create the
directory and one fails. By having the directory checked in, the SDK build will
not attempt to create the directory, and will not cause the error (it first
checks if the directory exists and if so it goes to the next step).

Besides providing an explanation for the add-ons directory, this README file is
lets us checkin that directory since git will not allow checkins of empty
directories.
