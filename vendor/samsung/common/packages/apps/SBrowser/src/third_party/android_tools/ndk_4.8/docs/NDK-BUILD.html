<h1>'ndk-build' Overview</h1>
<h2>I. Usage:</h2>
<p>The Android NDK r4 introduced a new tiny shell script, named 'ndk-build',
to simplify building machine code.</p>
<p>The script is located at the top-level directory of the NDK, and shall
be invoked from the command-line when in your application project
directory, or any of its sub-directories. For example:</p>
<pre><code>    cd $PROJECT
    $NDK/ndk-build
</code></pre>
<p>Where $NDK points to your NDK installation path. You can also create an
alias or add $NDK to your PATH to avoid typing it every time.</p>
<h2>II. Options:</h2>
<p>All parameters to 'ndk-build' are passed directly to the underlying GNU Make
command that runs the NDK build scripts. Notable uses include:</p>
<pre><code>    ndk-build                  --&gt; rebuild required machine code.
    ndk-build clean            --&gt; clean all generated binaries.

    ndk-build NDK_DEBUG=1      --&gt; generate debuggable native code.

    ndk-build V=1              --&gt; launch build, displaying build commands.

    ndk-build -B               --&gt; force a complete rebuild.

    ndk-build -B V=1           --&gt; force a complete rebuild and display build
                                  commands.

    ndk-build NDK_LOG=1        --&gt; display internal NDK log messages
                                  (used for debugging the NDK itself).

    ndk-build NDK_DEBUG=1      --&gt; force a debuggable build (see below)
    ndk-build NDK_DEBUG=0      --&gt; force a release build (see below)

    ndk-build NDK_HOST_32BIT=1 --&gt; Always use toolchain in 32-bit (see below)

    ndk-build NDK_APPLICATION_MK=&lt;file&gt;
      --&gt; rebuild, using a specific Application.mk pointed to by
          the NDK_APPLICATION_MK command-line variable.

    ndk-build -C &lt;project&gt;     --&gt; build the native code for the project
                                  path located at &lt;project&gt;. Useful if you
                                  don't want to 'cd' to it in your terminal.
</code></pre>
<h2>III. Debuggable versus Release builds:</h2>
<p>In NDK r5, ndk-build has been modified to make it easier to switch between
release and debug builds. This is done by using the <code>NDK_DEBUG</code> variable.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>    $NDK/ndk-build NDK_DEBUG=1  =&gt; forces the generation of debug binaries
    $NDK/ndk-build NDK_DEBUG=0  =&gt; forces the generation of release binaries
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't specify <code>NDK_DEBUG</code>, ndk-build will keep its default behaviour,
which is to inspect the AndroidManifest.xml, if any, and see if its
<application> element has android:debuggable="true".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IMPORTANT:
If you use the build tools of SDK r8 (or higher), you
won't need to touch your AndroidManifest.xml file at all!</p>
<p>That's because if you build a debug package (e.g. with
"ant debug" or the corresponding option of the ADT plugin),
the tool will  automatically pick the native debug files
generated with <code>NDK_DEBUG=1.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, as a convenience, the release and debug object files generated by the
NDK are now stored in different directories (e.g. obj/local/<abi>/objs and
obj/local/<abi>/objs-debug). This avoids having to recompile all your sources
when you switch between these two modes (even when you only modified one or
two source files).</p>
<h2>IV. 64-bit and 32-bit toolchains:</h2>
<p>Some toolchains come with both 64-bit and 32-bit versions.  For example,
directories <code>$NDK/toolchain/&lt;name&gt;/prebuilt</code> and <code>$NDK/prebuilt</code> may contains both
"<code>linux-x86</code>" and "<code>linux-x86_64</code>" folders for Linux tools in 32-bit and 64-bit modes,
respectively.  The ndk-build script automatically chooses a 64-bit version of the
toolchain if the host OS supports it.  You can force the use of a 32-bit toolchain by
using <code>NDK_HOST_32BIT=1</code> either in your envorinment or on the ndk-build command-line.</p>
<p>Note that 64-bit tools utilize host resources better (faster, handle larger
programs, etc) and they should function identically to their 32-bit counterparts.
Ie. 64-bit toolchains still generate 32-bit binaries for Android.</p>
<h2>V. Requirements:</h2>
<p>You need GNU Make 3.81 or later to use 'ndk-build' or the NDK in general.
The build scripts will detect that you're using a non-compliant Make tool
and will complain with an error message.</p>
<p>If you have GNU Make 3.81 installed, but that it is not launched by the
default 'make' command, define GNUMAKE in your environment to point to it
before launching 'ndk-build'. For example:</p>
<pre><code>    GNUMAKE=/usr/local/bin/gmake ndk-build
</code></pre>
<p>Or to make the change more permanent:</p>
<pre><code>    export GNUMAKE=/usr/local/bin/gmake
    ndk-build
</code></pre>
<p>Adapt to your shell and GNU Make 3.81 installation location.</p>
<p>You may override other host prebuilt tools in $NDK/prebuilt/<OS>/bin
with the following environment variables</p>
<pre><code>    NDK_HOST_AWK=&lt;path-to-awk&gt;

    NDK_HOST_ECHO=&lt;path-to-echo&gt;

    NDK_HOST_CMP=&lt;path-to-cmp&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>VI. Internals:</h2>
<p>'ndk-build' itself is a tiny wrapper around GNU Make, its purpose is simply
to invoke the right NDK build script, it is equivalent to;</p>
<pre><code>    $GNUMAKE -f $NDK/build/core/build-local.mk [parameters]
</code></pre>
<p>Where '$GNUMAKE' points to GNU Make 3.81 or later, and $NDK points to your
NDK installation directory.</p>
<p>Use this knowledge if you want to invoke the NDK build script from other
shell scripts (or even your own Makefiles).</p>
