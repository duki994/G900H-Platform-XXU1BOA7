<h1>Android NDK CPU Features detection library:</h1>
<p>This NDK provides a small library named "<code>cpufeatures</code>" that can be used at
runtime to detect the target device's CPU family and the optional features
it supports.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>The library is available as an import module. To use it, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>List '<code>cpufeatures</code>' in your list of static library dependencies, as in:</p>
<pre><code>LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES := cpufeatures
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of your Android.mk, import the '<code>android/cpufeatures</code>' module,
    as in:</p>
<pre><code>$(call import-module,android/cpufeatures)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>In your source code, include the header named <code>&lt;cpu-features.h&gt;</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a simple example:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;project-path&gt;/jni/Android.mk:
        LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)

        include $(CLEAR_VARS)
        LOCAL_MODULE := &lt;your-module-name&gt;
        LOCAL_SRC_FILES := &lt;your-source-files&gt;
        LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES := cpufeatures
        include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)

        $(call import-module,android/cpufeatures)
</code></pre>
<h2>Features:</h2>
<p>Two functions are provided for now:</p>
<pre><code>    AndroidCpuFamily android_getCpuFamily();
</code></pre>
<p>Returns the target device's CPU Family as an enum. For now, the only
supported family is ANDROID_CPU_FAMILY_ARM.</p>
<pre><code>    uint64_t android_getCpuFeatures();
</code></pre>
<p>Returns the set of optional features supported by the device's CPU.
The result is a set of bit-flags, each corresponding to one CPU
Family-specific optional feature.</p>
<p>Currently, only the following flags are defined, for the ARM CPU Family:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ANDROID_CPU_ARM_FEATURE_VFPv2</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indicates that the device's CPU supports VFPv2 instruction set.
    Most ARMv6 CPUs support these.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ANDROID_CPU_ARM_FEATURE_ARMv7</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indicates that the device's CPU supports the ARMv7-A instruction
    set as supported by the "armeabi-v7a" abi (see <a href="CPU-ARCH-ABIS.html">CPU-ARCH-ABIS</a>).
    This corresponds to Thumb-2 and VFPv3-D16 instructions.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ANDROID_CPU_ARM_FEATURE_VFPv3</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indicates that the device's CPU supports the VFPv3 hardware FPU
    instruction set extension. Due to the definition of 'armeabi-v7a',
    this will always be the case if ANDROID_CPU_ARM_FEATURE_ARMv7 is
    returned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that this corresponds to the minimum profile VFPv3-D16 that
<em>only</em> provides 16 hardware double-precision FP registers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ANDROID_CPU_ARM_FEATURE_VFP_D32</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indicates that the device's CPU supports 32 hardware double-precision
    FP registers instead of 16.  Note that there are still only 32 single-
    precision registers mapped to the same register banks.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ANDROID_CPU_ARM_FEATURE_NEON</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indicates that the device's CPU supports the ARM Advanced SIMD
    (a.k.a. NEON) vector instruction set extension. Note that ARM
    mandates that such CPUs also implement VFPv3-D32, which provides
    32 hardware FP registers (shared with the NEON unit).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ANDROID_CPU_ARM_FEATURE_VFP_FP16</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indicates that the device's CPU supports instructions to perform
    floating-point operations on 16-bit registers. This is part of the
    VFPv4 specification.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ANDROID_CPU_ARM_FEATURE_VFP_FMA</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indicates that the device's CPU supports fused multiply-accumulate
    VFP instructions extension. Also part of the VFPv4 specification.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ANDROID_CPU_ARM_FEATURE_NEON_FMA</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indicates that the device's CPU supports fused multiply-accumulate
    NEON instructions extension.  Also part of the VFPv4 specification.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ANDROID_CPU_ARM_FEATURE_IDIV_ARM</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indicates that the device's CPU supports Integer division in ARM mode.
    Only available on recent CPUs (e.g. Cortex-A15).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ANDROID_CPU_ARM_FEATURE_IDIV_THUMB2</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indicates that the device's CPU supports Integer division in Thumb-2
    mode.  Only available on recent CPUs (e.g. Cortex-A15).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ANDROID_CPU_ARM_FEATURE_iWMMXt</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indicates that the device's CPU supports extension that adds MMX
    registers and instructions.  This is only available on a few XScale-
    based CPU.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ANDROID_CPU_ARM_FEATURE_LDREX_STREX</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indicates that the device's CPU supports LDREX and STREX instructions
    available since ARMv6.  Together they provide atomic update on memory
    with the help of exclusive monitor.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And the following flags for the x86 CPU Family:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ANDROID_CPU_X86_FEATURE_SSSE3</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indicates that the device's CPU supports the SSSE3 instruction
    extension set. Note that this is unlike SSE3 which is required
    by the x86 NDK ABI.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ANDROID_CPU_X86_FEATURE_POPCNT</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indicates that the device's CPU supports the POPCNT instruction.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ANDROID_CPU_X86_FEATURE_MOVBE</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indicates that the device's CPU supports the MOVBE instruction.
    This one is specific to some Intel IA-32 CPUs, like the Atom.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following function is also defined to return the max number of
CPU cores on the target device:</p>
<pre><code>    int  android_getCpuCount(void);
</code></pre>
<h2>Important Note:</h2>
<p>The cpufeatures library will be updated to support more CPU families and
optional features in the future. It is designed to work as-is on all
official Android platform versions.</p>
