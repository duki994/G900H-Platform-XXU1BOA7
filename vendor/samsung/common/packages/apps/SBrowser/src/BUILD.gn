# you add a new build file, there must be some path of dependencies from this
# file to your new one or GN won't know about it.

# In GN, a "group" is a dummy target that just lists other targets.

  # hybrid build, and GN will not generate a GYP file for it. This flag is
  # ignored in the pure GN build.
