**Native Client** is a sandbox for running compiled C and C++ code in the
browser efficiently and securely, independent of the user's operating system.
**Portable Native Client** extends that technology with
architecture independence, letting developers compile their code once to run
in any website and on any architecture.

In short, Native Client brings the **performance** and **low-level control**
of native code to modern web browsers, without sacrificing the **security** and
**portability** of the web. Watch the video below for an overview of
Native Client, including its goals, how it works, and how
Portable Native Client lets developers run native compiled code on the web.
