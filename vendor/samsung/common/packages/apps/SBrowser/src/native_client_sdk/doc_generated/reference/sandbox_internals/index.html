<p>The sandbox internals documentation describes implementation details for
Native Client sandboxing, which is also used by Portable Native
Client. These details can be useful to reimplement a sandbox, or to
write assembly code that follows sandboxing rules for Native Client
(Portable Native Client does not allow platform-specific assembly code).</p>
